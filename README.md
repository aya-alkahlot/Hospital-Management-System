Ø±Hospital Management System (HMS)
Hospital Management System using MySQL, PhP, HTML5, CSS3, JS and Bootstrap.


We developed a cloud-based healthcare management system (HMS) that is designed to streamline and automate the management of healthcare services. HMS offers a user-friendly interface for administrators, doctors, and patients to efficiently manage and track healthcare activities. It facilitates patient registration, uploading medical records, appointment scheduling, and interactive communication tools. With features like unique patient ID generation, appointment conflict resolution, and secure cloud-based data management, HMS ensures scalability and accessibility for healthcare providers of all sizes.



HMS Requirements
HMS consists of 3 components,Patient,Doctor and Admin

They generate unique patient and doctor IDs, handle account management, and ensure secure data access.

4. The System (HMS):

HMS is responsible for generating highly secure and unique patient IDs upon administrator approval of registration requests.

We, as a team of four, collaborated equally on both the project and its documentation, ensuring a fair and balanced distribution of tasks among us. Each member actively contributed and took responsibility for specific sections, demonstrating teamwork and commitment to delivering the project as a cohesive effort.

Due to unreliable internet connectivity, we were unable to upload the project to GitHub incrementally. Instead, we ensured the project was thoroughly completed before uploading it in its entirety at once.
